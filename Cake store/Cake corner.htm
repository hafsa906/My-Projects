                    found the perfect cupcake! By the way, our lunch was also wonderful (I had your crab panini -
                    fantastic!) and we are excited to become regular customers. Thank you again" </p>

                    was the talk of the party, and the pictures were passed around far and wide (even to a daughter in
                    Malawi!). He thought it was awesome, as did everyone else. And it tasted as good as it looked. The
                    cupcakes didn't last long either.Everyone asked where I had it made and I made sure to tell them it
                    was done by Frost Me Sweet. Thanks again.</p>
